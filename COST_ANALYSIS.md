Base monthly allowance:

The Pay As You Go plan includes 500 free messages per month.

Total messages to be sent: 5000/month

Messages beyond the included 500 = 5,000 âˆ’ 500 = 4,500 additional messages.

The Pay As You Go plan charges $20 for each additional block of 5,000 messages.

Since 4,500 messages fit within a single 5,000-message block, the cost applies only once.

Total monthly cost: $20 for the extra messages block, as the included 500 messages are free.

Final Conclusion: 

5,000 total messages = 500 free + 4,500 paid messages.

The cost for 5,000 messages on Pay As You Go will be $20 per month.
